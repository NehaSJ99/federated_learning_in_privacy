# Federated Learning (FL)

## Overview
Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach where models are trained on distributed data across multiple devices or locations without centralizing the data. This approach addresses challenges like privacy, data ownership, and bandwidth limitations.

## Key Idea

### Problem
- **Data Scarcity:** Models require diverse, large-scale data.
- **Unused Data:** Data is often distributed and remains unutilized.
- **Centralization Challenges:** Centralizing data is difficult or impossible in many cases.

### Solution
FL operates on distributed data and devices, enabling collaborative model training without requiring data centralization.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**  
   The server initializes the global model.

2. **Communication Round**  
   The server sends the global model to selected clients.

3. **Client Training and Model Update**  
   Clients train the received model on their local datasets and send updated models back to the server.

4. **Model Aggregation**  
   The server aggregates the updates from clients using an aggregation method.

5. **Convergence Check**  
   - If the convergence criteria are met, the FL process ends.  
   - Otherwise, repeat from Step 2.

## Federated Learning Hyperparameters

### Server-Side
- **Client Selection**: Choose clients for participation.
- **Client Configuration**: Define client-specific settings.
- **Result Aggregation**: Aggregate client updates.

### Client-Side
- **Pre-Processing**: Prepare local data.
- **Local Training**: Train the model on local datasets.
- **Post-Processing**: Process and send updates to the server.

## Privacy in Federated Learning

FL minimizes direct access to data, but some privacy risks exist.

### Attack Types
- **Membership Inference Attack:** Identify data samples in the training set.
- **Attribute Inference Attack:** Infer unseen attributes from training data.
- **Reconstruction Attack:** Reconstruct specific training data samples.
- **Client/Server/Third-Party Attacks:** Exploit vulnerabilities in the FL process.

### Privacy Enhancements
- **Differential Privacy (DP):**  
  - **Central DP:** Add noise at the server.  
  - **Local DP:** Add noise at the client.

## Bandwidth Optimization

### Bandwidth Formula
\[
(\text{Model Size (out)} + \text{Model Size (in)}) \times \text{Cohort Size} \times \text{Fraction Selected} \times \text{Number of Rounds}
\]

### Techniques
- **Reduce Update Size:** Apply sparsification or quantization.
- **Reduce Communication:** Perform more local training epochs.

## Advantages
- **Data Privacy:** Raw data is not shared.
- **Efficient Utilization:** Leverages distributed, unused data.
- **Scalable:** Operates on diverse devices and locations.

---

## Applications
- **Healthcare:** Training models on patient data across hospitals.  
- **Mobile Applications:** Personalized models on user devices.  
- **Finance:** Fraud detection without sharing sensitive data.

## Getting Started

1. **Server Initialization:** Start with a global model.
2. **Client Selection:** Define client participation for each round.
3. **Local Training:** Implement client-side training workflows.
4. **Model Aggregation:** Integrate updates using aggregation methods.
5. **Privacy Measures:** Add Differential Privacy for enhanced data security.
